<li> Webcam - Just because you had signed an agreement of use it does not make it ethically right to turn on the webcam of your phone, computer, or laptop and watch people through that camera.
<li> Ad Pop-Ups - It is not okay for companies to track your movements whenever you are on the web. Anything you search up or any website you visit is collected.
